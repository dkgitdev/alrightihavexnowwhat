Hold either key to get full list of shortcuts shows.

Notable mentions:
- `S + L1` â€“ magnifire glass mode

# Issues

Various nasty stuff. Even Valve isn't perfect.

## Keyboard / in-game Overlay (like thouchpad menus) not visible and not interactible.

Solution: reboot.

Notes: This happens a lot more frequently when using Decky.

# Frame generation via LS
1. Install Decky
2. Install [decky-lsfg-vk Plugin](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/decky-lsfg-vk)
3. configure in plugin the settings you want for a game / globally
4. Copy command from plugin and set it in the game's properties.
5. Run game and ensure it's working.

Notes:
- Decky plugin and decky itself is an easy way to install and configure lsfg-vk, but once you're done they can be removed. Just keep the game's start command custom, and it'll be fine.
